In today’s rapidly developing society, it’s not surprising to find out that almost everyone feels certain degrees of anxiety. When it comes to work place, people can be facing high workloads and tight deadlines. When it comes to school, students might be experiencing peer pressure academically. When it comes to family, people are under pressure of taking responsibility consistently. When it comes to success, some might be concerned about the definition of success.
