### Description:
For this exploratory data project, our team will look at a four-year NHIS data on 18-65 aged adults, focusing on the relationship between anxiety and other general factors such as gender and employment. Moreover, we will further our analysis by looking at other health factors like heart disease that could be correlated with feelings of anxiety.
